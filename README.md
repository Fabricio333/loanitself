# The Loan That Pays Itself

This repo contains a small landing page for **theloanthatpaysitself.com**. It explains three Bitcoin-backed loan strategies with KaTeX math boxes and placeholders for stick-figure illustrations.

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the strategies page. A second page, `collateralized_loans.html`, provides a simple overview of how collateralized loans work using stickâ€‘man style mindmaps. Replace the placeholder images when your graphics are ready.
